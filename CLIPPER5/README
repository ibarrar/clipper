2. Installation
   
   The interactive installation program, INSTALL.EXE, copies the
   CA-Clipper 5.2 files to the appropriate directories and
   subdirectories of your hard disk.  The installation procedure is
   documented in Chapter 2 of the Getting Started Guide, but this
   section contains additional information that you may need to
   successfully install CA-Clipper 5.2.
   
   Important:  The CA-Clipper 5.2 installation program default
   installation directory is \CLIPPER5.  If you have a previous
   version of CA-Clipper installed into a directory with this name,
   you will need to modify the install program default directory
   (when prompted), otherwise your previous version of CA-Clipper
   will be overwritten.
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   2.1  Command Line Arguments
   
   The following table shows the command line arguments for
   INSTALL.EXE.
   
   INSTALL.EXE Command Line Arguments
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   
   Argument       Description
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   
   /NOSWAP        Do not swap to EMS or disk
   /BW            Monochrome for color display (for Laptops)
   /MONO          Force monochrome display
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   2.2  Default Directory Structure
   
   The CA-Clipper 5.2 directory structure created by the installation
   procedure is as follows:
   
   \CLIPPER5        Master CA-Clipper 5.2 directory
      \BIN             Executable (.EXE and .COM), batch (.BAT), and
                       help (.hlp) files
      \INCLUDE         Header (.CH and .H) files
      \LIB             Library (.LIB) files
      \PLL             Prelinked library (.PLL, .PLT, and .LNK) files
      \OBJ             Object (.OBJ) files
      \SOURCE          Master directory for source (.prg) files
         \DBU             Database Utility source files
         \PE              Program editor source files
         \RL              Report and Label Utility source files
         \SYS             Source files for runtime systems
                          (Get system, Error system, runtime portions
                          of the Report and Label system, and
                          Rddsys.prg)

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   2.3  Modifying Your Environment Variables
   
   Certain environment variables (e.g., PATH, LIB, INCLUDE) should be
   set for CA-Clipper 5.2.  If you elected to modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file during the installation process, your file should be up-to-
   date.  Otherwise, the appropriate settings are written to a file
   called AUTOEXEC.NEW located in the root directory of the boot
   drive.  In either case, it is important that your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file contain these additional settings so that CA-Clipper 5.2 will
   find your files.  The required settings are as follows:
   
   1. The PATH variable should include the directory where CA-Clipper
      5.2 executable files reside (example: C:\CLIPPER5\BIN).
      
   2. The LIB variable should include the directory where CA-Clipper
      5.2 library files reside (example: C:\CLIPPER5\LIB).
      
   3. The INCLUDE variable should include the directory where
      CA-Clipper 5.2 include files reside (example:
      C:\CLIPPER5\INCLUDE).
      
   4. The PLL variable should include the directory where CA-Clipper
      5.2 prelinked library files reside (example: C:\CLIPPER5\PLL).
      
   For example:
   
   SET PATH=C:\CLIPPER5\BIN;%PATH%
   SET LIB=C:\CLIPPER5\LIB
   SET INCLUDE=C:\CLIPPER5\INCLUDE
   SET PLL=C:\CLIPPER5\PLL
   
   You may also wish to set other environment variables.  For a
   summary of environment variables used and supported by CA-Clipper
   5.2, refer to Chapter 10 of the Quick Reference Guide.  For more
   information on setting up and using the CA-Clipper development
   environment, refer to the Programming and Utilities Guide.  For
   general information about the DOS environment and setting
   environment variables, refer to your DOS manual.
   
   The installation program modifies CONFIG.SYS to:
   
   FILES=25
   BUFFERS=15
   
   If you choose to retain your current CONFIG.SYS the installation
   program creates a file named CONFIG.NEW and places it in the root
   directory of your boot drive.

               (Sample Program Reference)
   C52G07B.NG   CA-Clipper Drivers Documentation
               (Complete Drivers Guide online)
   
   All of the documentation databases and the Instant Access Engine
   are installed in the \NG directory, which exists at the same level
   as the \CLIPPER5 directory.
   
========================================================================
4. Drivers
   
   CA-Clipper 5.2 includes new replaceable database drivers (RDDs) as
   well as enhanced functionality in the default DBFNTX and the
   DBFNDX drivers.  The included database drivers are DBFNTX
   (CA-Clipper indexes), DBFNDX (dBASE III compatible indexes),
   DBFMDX (dBASE IV compatible multiple indexes), DBFCDX (FoxPro
   compatible indexes) and DBPX (Paradox compatible tables).
   
   CA-Clipper 5.2 documentation includes a Drivers Guide that
   describes the RDDs, their new and enhanced command set, and the
   alternate Terminal drivers.
   
   Please note:  The online version of the DBFNTX Driver
   documentation contains "new" information about DBFNTX's optional
   new locking scheme.  Please be sure to refer to this section if
   using the DBFNTX driver.
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   4.1  Alternate Terminal Drivers Instructions
   
   The GT.OBJ supplied in the \CLIPPER5\OBJ directory must be used
   with the Alternate Terminal Drivers PCBIOS and ANSITERM.  This
   object replaces the default GT.OBJ that is contained in
   CLIPPER.LIB.  Failing to link in this replacement GT.OBJ will
   result in improper screen displays and possibly cause the computer
   to hang when using the alternate drivers.
   
   Note:  GT.OBJ does not support the horizontal argument in the
   SCROLL() function nor does it support _gtDispBegin(),
   _gtDispEnd(), or _gtDispCount().
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   4.2     Nantucket Tools II Instructions

   The CT2PATCH.OBJ supplied in the \CLIPPER5\OBJ directory adds 
   TOOLS II compatibility to CA-Clipper 5.2.  You should always use 
   it with CA-Clipper 5.2 applications that utilize TOOLS II.  This 
   is not necessary for users that do not have TOOLS II.  The 
   CTUS.OBJ supplied in the \CLIPPER5\OBJ directory replaces the 
   NT2US50.OBJ object initially shipped with TOOLS II.  Use CTUS.OBJ
   with CA-Clipper 5.2 applications that utilize TOOLS II and 
   NT2US50.OBJ.  This is not necessary for users that do not have 
   TOOLS II.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   4.3  Database Driver Interoperability
   
   When using the APPEND FROM and COPY TO commands with either
   DELIMITED or SDF data, the allowable data types are limited to
   valid CA-Clipper data types.  Drivers that support "extended" data
   types will only be able to copy to and from DELIMITED or SDF data
   using databases that contain only valid CA-Clipper data types.
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   4.4  Addendum: to Drivers Reference Chapter
   
   Commands and functions that open indexes behave differently than
   documented when using (.mdx) and (.cdx) indexes.  On these "multi-
   tag" indexes, the index order is not automatically set to the
   first tag in the index.  Instead, the order is set to 0 (natural
   order).  Therefore, you must set the index order to the desired
   tag before performing any action that requires an index (e.g.,
   SEEK).  This affects the following commands and functions: SET
   INDEX, DBSETINDEX(), and ORDLISTADD().
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   4.5  DBFCDX Driver note
   
   EVAL and EVERY clauses of the INDEX ON command
   
   The EVAL clause functions differently in the DBFCDX driver than it
   does in other RDDs.  The EVAL block is evaluated at the beginning
   and at the end of each indexing process as well as at each record
   as in other RDDs.  At the beginning of the index process both
   BOF() and EOF() are true (.T.).  At the end of the indexing
   process only EOF() is true (.T.).
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   4.6.1  DBPX Driver Notes
   
   Creating Secondary Indexes
   
   The DBPX Driver automatically creates two index files of the same
   name as the table whenever indexes are created.  These files have
   the extensions (.x??) and (.y??) where "??" represents the ordinal
   position of the key field.
   
   Example:
   
      USE Customer               // Contains fields Lastname
                                 // and Phone
      
      INDEX ON Lastname TO Temp1 // Creates CUSTOMER.X01 and
                                 // CUSTOMER.Y01.
                                 // The name "Temp1" is ignored
      
      INDEX ON Phone TO Temp2    // Creates CUSTOMER.X02 and
                                 // CUSTOMER.Y02.
                                 // The name "Temp2" is ignored.
      
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   4.6.2  Opening Secondary Indexes
   
   Since all secondary indexes take the name of the table, you open
   and access them by the name of their key field.
   
   Example:
   
      // Continuing the example in 4.6.1:
      
      SET INDEX TO Lastname          // Open the index using the
      
                                     // name of the key field,
                                     // not "Temp1"
      
      SET INDEX TO Lastname, Phone   // Open the indexes using the
                                     // names of the key fields.
      
      ORDSETFOCUS("Phone")           // Set "Phone" as the
                                     // controlling index
      
========================================================================
5. Error Handling
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   5.1  (b) LOCKERRHAN
   
   During abnormal program terminations or when the program is
   canceled by Alt-C, CA-Clipper 5.2 produces a trace back of all the
   functions active at the time of termination.  Users who are used
   to this information will find a new item in the trace back that
   looks like (b) LOCKERRHAN.  This is a special error handler that
   is automatically installed as an INIT procedure.  This is normal.
   Other error handlers installed by INIT procedures, created by
   third-party vendors or applications developers will show up in
   this manner as well.
   
========================================================================
6. New Error Messages
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   6.1  DBFCDX/1050  Create error
   
   Explanation:  The maximum number of Orders per Order Bag was
   exceeded.  The allowable number of Orders that an Order Bag can
   contain varies by database driver.  See the Drivers guide.
   
   Action:  Create a new Order Bag (index file).
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   6.2  DBFMDX/1028  Create error
   
   Explanation:  The maximum number of Orders per Order Bag was
   exceeded.  The allowable number of Orders that an Order Bag can
   contain varies by database driver.  See the Drivers guide.
   
   Action:  Create a new Order Bag (index file).
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   6.3  DBPX/306  Create error
   
   Explanation:  Insufficient memory for an operation like SORT.  It
   is unlikely that this error will occur in the current version.
   
   Action:  Allocate more conventional memory.  Do this by removing
   TSRs, using a 386 memory manager, etc.  Ensure that any C or
   assembly language code in use is using the virtual memory system
   if it is performing dynamic memory allocation.  Any memory
   allocated using the Fixed Memory Allocator function (_xalloc() and
   _xgrab()) reduces the amount of conventional memory available.
   Free this memory as soon as possible after use.
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   6.4  DBPX/503  Create error
   
   Explanation:  An error was encountered creating, reading or
   writing a table, a lock file, or a temporary file.
   
   Action:  Make sure that sufficient disk space and directory
   entries are available.  If the file exists, make sure it is not
   marked read-only.  In a network environment, make sure the
   application has the necessary rights to create the file.
   
   See Also:  INDEX command, Network Programming chapter in the
   Programming and Utilities guide
   
========================================================================
7. Utilities
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   7.1  DBU Network Capable Features
   
   The DBU sample program has been updated to allow shared use of
   databases.  By default, DBU now opens all databases in shared mode
   and automatically performs the necessary record locks when writing
   data.
   
   Additionally, anytime a database must be opened exclusively (e.g.,
   CREATE INDEX, MODIFY STRUCTURE, ZAP) DBU automatically reopens the
   file in exclusive mode.  Should opening the file in exclusive mode
   fail, DBU attempts to reopen it in shared mode so that you can
   continue.
   
   All operations are done transparently.  If an error occurs, the
   user is notified and recovery is automatic.  In Browse mode,
   changes made by another user are automatically reflected in your
   Browse screen.
   
========================================================================
8. Sample Programs
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   8.1  SAMPLES.LIB
   
   Included in the \CLIPPER5\LIB directory is a new library called
   SAMPLES.LIB.  It contains most of the samples in compiled, ready
   to use form.  To use any of the sample functions you can include
   SAMPLES.LIB in your link line as follows:
   
     RTLINK FI <appObjectList> LIB SAMPLES
   
========================================================================
9. Memory
   
   9.1  Free Memory and Load size
   
   Free Memory is the amount of memory available to run applications.
   You can find this value by using the MEM command in DOS version
   5.0, or CHKDSK in earlier versions of DOS.
   
   Load Size is the amount of memory used by the application as it is
   loaded into memory by DOS.  .RTLink reports this value (in
   Kilobytes) at the end of a successful link.
   
   Applications require an amount of memory beyond Load Size, for
   data storage.  The approximate total memory to run an application
   is :
   
                                 minimum:    120K over load size
          desirable for best performance:   +160K over load size
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   9.2  Fixed Memory (FM) Usage
   
   To reduce the memory requirement of your application, you should
   convert your C and ASM modules to use Virtual Memory instead of
   Fixed Memory.  The VM.API headers accompany these files, but the
   documentation will be available later (be sure to mail the
   included card).
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   9.3  CA-Clipper File Services
   
   You may reduce the load size of a CA-Clipper application by using
   the built-in CA-Clipper file I/O services instead of the Microsoft
   runtime services.  The FILESYS.API headers accompany these files,
   but the documentation will be available later (be sure to mail the
   included card).
   
========================================================================
10.Compatibility Issues
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Compiler Kit for dBASE IV
   
   The dBASE IV Kit, version 1.10 is not compatible with CA-Clipper
   5.2.  You can only use version 1.5 of the dBASE IV Kit with
   CA-Clipper 5.2.
   
========================================================================
11.Errata
   
   11.1  Reference Guide
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   11.1.1  Page 2-62, (Compound Assign) operator
   
   The documentation states that the correct operator for doing
   compound exponentiation/assignment is **=.  This is not correct.
   The correct operator is ^=.  Thus, the syntax and all references
   to **= must be changed to ^=.  There is also a note in this
   entry that states:
   
   Note:  The exponentiation operator (^) does not have a
   corresponding compound assignment operator.  The exponentiation
   compound assignment operator is **=.
   
   Replace this paragraph with:
   
   Note:  The exponentiation operator (**) does not have a
   corresponding compound assignment operator.  The exponentiation
   compound assignment operator is ^=.
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   11.1.2  Page 2-244, DBSETFILTER() function
   
   The description of the <cCondition> parameter should read:
   
   <cCondition> stores the filter condition as a character string
   for later retrieval by the DBFILTER() function.  If you omit
   this optional parameter, the DBFILTER() function will return an
   empty string for the work area.
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   11.1.3  Page 2-373, Get class
   
   Under the Examples heading, the last line of code:
   
      objGet:postBlock := { |cValue| !EMPTY(cValue) }
      
   should read:
   
      objGet:postBlock := { |oGet| !EMPTY(oGet:varGet()) }
      
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   11.1.4  Page 2-479, OUTSTD() function
   
   The reference to SIMPLIO.CH in both the Description and Files
   section of the OUTSTD() function entry should be SIMPLIO.CH.
   
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   11.1.5  Page 2-525, REINDEX command
   
   The command syntax has too many square brackets at the end.  The
   syntax should read:
   
      REINDEX [EVAL <lCondition>]
         [EVERY <nRecords>]
      
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   11.1.6  Page 2-416, LASTREC() function
   
   Because of the expanded functionality of RECNO() to encompass the
   concept of "identity", we wish to state here that the LASTREC()
   function continues to return only record numbers - not identities.
   LASTREC() has no expanded functionality so it is not "identity
   aware"

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   11.4.2.  Page 3-27,  ORDCREATE()
   
   In the ORDCREATE() syntax, the code block is not optional.  The
   syntax should be:
   
      ORDCREATE( <cOrderBagName>,[<cOrderName>],
         <cExpKey>, <bExpKey>, [<lUnique>]) --> NIL
      
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   11.4.3  Page 8-6,  Primary Indexes
   
   To clarify the documentation on the creation of key violation
   tables: a key violation table (KEYVIOL.DB) is created only on the
   APPEND FROM command, when the source is a (.db) file and the
   destination is a keyed (.db) file.

   11.4.6  Page 8-8,  Passwords and Security
   
   The current Paradox driver, contrary to the documentation, does
   NOT support Passwords and Security.
   
   Contrary to the documentation, you may have more than twenty-four
   Paradox tables open at one time.  The number of files is
   determined by the available memory.  You may have up to fifteen
   secondary indexes open in any work area.
