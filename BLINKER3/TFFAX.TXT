Welcome to Technical Fax!

TF/Fax, a service of Blink, Inc., allows you to receive technical notes,
product information and upgrade information right on your fax machine.
Using TF/Fax is easy.  Here's what you do:

1.  Read through the list below and pick out faxes which are of interest
to you.  Then pick up the touch tone phone at your fax machine and call
(804) 747-5333. TF/Fax is available 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.   If
your call is not answered after the first ring, the system is busy or
temporarily off line.  Please try again later.  This number is for
outgoing TF/Fax service only.  If you want to send us a fax, send to
(804) 747-4200.

2.  Wait for the recorded message.  Using your touch tone phone, enter
the number for the desired fax, either when the message prompts you, or
at any time during the message prior to the prompt.  The next message
will verify the fax you selected.  If that is correct, enter one (1) at
the prompt, otherwise enter zero (0).  You will be prompted to request
as many as five faxes.

3.  After you have requested all the faxes you want, wait for the next
recorded prompt and enter zero (0) to have those faxes transmitted.

4.  Do not hang up.  Wait for the beep, then press the 'START/COPY' or
'RECEIVE' button on your fax machine.  This is often the green button on
your machine.  You may then hang up and transmission of the fax should
begin shortly.

FOR QUICK ACCESS TO ALL OF THESE TECHNICAL SUPPORT BULLETINS, THEY HAVE
BEEN COMBINED INTO ONE FILE, --BULLETIN.ZIP--, WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO BE
DOWNLOADED FROM OUR BBS (804-747-7333).
